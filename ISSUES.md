# Design Issues & Questions

1. The yu student repos are not technically owned by Judah, they are part of an organization (Yeshiva-University-CS). This means that their "absolute" name is Yeshiva-University-CS/GottesmanShalom. In the CVS format section, you will see a header "User", This was made with the thinking that the owner's name would always be the User. This is not the case, it should be updated to repo owner, which in our case is  Yeshiva-University-CS instead of Judah or ShalomGottesman, for example. (if this was not clear, I am attaching the csv file that commands the system to add me to all the repos for data structures this term, I am also attaching a csv file the Judah used to add all the students to the starting code repository, this file though has its middle column blank as I did not have the repository name when I generated the file, Judah filled it in)

2. My project is based on an open source abstraction of the GitHub API. There are pieces of this project that go beyond the work they have done and I have submitted changes to them which have been approved but not yet released, so some of the dependencies might cause some weird text output to the screen (especially if you use the one-jar compiling option, see the READEME.txt aforementioned). Once the next version of that code gets released there will have to be an update to my project to account for their update

3. As of current, the main thing I want to add to the project is the ability to add a collaborator with read-only privileges. I am aware on how it is done, but have to implement it.

4. Lastly, this is something that I want to discuss further from a design perspective. GitHub is disallowing users to use their main password in the API, rather they must use a Personal Access Token (PAT, see https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). These codes are meant to be stored somewhere on the computer (this is done when you log into your local git controller once and you credentials get cached). This means that unless I want to make the user either generate a new code per program use, or store it themselves on the computer, I have to create some sort of password vault specific to TeachHub, or interface some other software that is standard in most Operating Systems. Do you have any thoughts on the matter? As an aside, you do not have to worry about this yet as I think they are only making the change in June.
